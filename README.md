The current method of the visitor management is mainly based on manual recording of visitor information in a counter book something that makes it extremely difficult to track, 
monitor and retrieve visitor information. The current manual visitor recording systems are observed in several companies, organizations, schools and so many other places. 
The manual system hugely affects organizations with tracking, monitoring and information retrieval issues. this web based system helps you to achieve that in a more efficent 
manner.
